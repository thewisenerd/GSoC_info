OpenBEL is an open source and open community project providing BEL (Biological Expression Language) and a set of tools to process/store biological knowledge. As BEL expressions may become very complex, our project aims to develop a web visualization tool for BEL graph to enhance user's comprehension and interaction, using HTML5 and Javascript libraries.
