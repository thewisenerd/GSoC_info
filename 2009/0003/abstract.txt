Most modern processors have Memory Management Unit Hardware built into the processor whose main functions are virtual address translation, memory protection and cache control. With RTEMS primarily focused on Embedded Real Time applications, making use of these MMU features especially Memory Protection is important to meet the needs of those applications that requires such support. RTEMS currently does not have MMU support and this project proposes to add this as part of the GSoC Programme.
