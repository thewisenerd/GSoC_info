The aim of this project is to develop a Picasa plugin for Canola. The plugin will be able to access the web albums stored at Picasa, to upload new pictures, to add/update descriptions and tags). The plugin will ease and shorten the process of taking and sharing a picture on the Internet. It will also use GPS data to fill location information in picture's meta-data and to search for pictures taken in current region.
