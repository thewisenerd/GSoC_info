DICOM currently defines Image IODs by storing the rows and columns as unsigned short integer. This means that an image can only be at most of size 2^16 * 2^16 pixels. This is a limitation for Microscopy Images as, for example, WSI can go up to Terabytes in extreme conditions.In addition to these “hard” restrictions, another consideration is due to large amount of information in these images rapid panning and zooming should also be supported.
